I ___ watching TV
I ___ going to bed
I ___ feeling great
I ___ walking to work
I ___ playing a game
I ___ listening to music
I ___ learning English
I ___ writing my notes
I ___ doing my homework
I ___ studying now
I ___ waiting for the bus
I ___ at the park
I ___ drinking coffee
I ___ talking to my friend
I ___ thinking about lunch
I ___ ready for class
In the morning, I ___ usually tired
I always forget where I ___ supposed to be
I ___ not sure what time it is
Sometimes I ___ late for work
I ___ the one who cleans the kitchen
I ___ really focused on this task
Right now, I ___ waiting outside
When it rains, I ___ usually at home
I ___ proud of my progress
I ___ not interested in that movie
I ___ feeling a bit nervous today
Even when I ___ busy, I read a little
I ___ not good at cooking yet
I ___ still trying to improve
People say I ___ too quiet sometimes
When I ___ done, I’ll call you
I ___ always early to meetings
If I ___ correct, that’s her house
I ___ enjoying the quiet this morning
I ___ not sure how to say this
I often wonder why I ___ so tired
Sometimes I forget I ___ human
I ___ learning to be patient
I ___ finally starting to relax
I ___ more confident than before
When I ___ working, time passes fast
I ___ lucky to have good friends
I ___ happy you called me today
Even when I ___ scared, I try again
I ___ always trying to do better
After a long day, I ___ completely exhausted
I ___ not the kind of person who gives up
The reason I ___ here is to learn
I ___ certain that this will work
When everyone’s asleep, I ___ still awake
I ___ thinking about my next goal
Some days I ___ full of energy, others not
I ___ beginning to understand myself
Even when I’m quiet, I ___ listening
I ___ the only one who saw what happened
Whenever I travel, I ___ amazed by people
I ___ trying to find balance in my life
I ___ not afraid to make mistakes anymore
I ___ learning to manage my time better
No matter what, I ___ grateful for today
I ___ still unsure about the decision
I ___ focused on small steps every day
Whenever I feel lost, I ___ writing again
I ___ proud of how far I’ve come
I ___ ready to move forward
After all these years, I ___ still curious
I ___ wondering what life will bring next
I ___ not perfect, but I try my best
I ___ aware that change takes time
I ___ getting stronger each week
I ___ finally at peace with myself
I ___ learning that rest is important
Every morning I ___ thankful to be alive
I ___ confident that effort brings results
When I wake up early, I ___ more productive
I ___ the one who always keeps promises
I ___ always open to learning new things
I ___ doing my best to stay positive
I ___ certain I chose the right path
Even when I ___ wrong, I learn something
I ___ more organized than I used to be
I ___ constantly trying to improve my focus
I ___ the kind of person who plans ahead
Whenever I feel anxious, I ___ breathing deeply
I ___ learning to enjoy quiet moments
I ___ finding joy in simple things
